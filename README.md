#Digital Privacy Notice#
-----------------------

##This program provide a standardized online notice of Privacy Practice.##

The HIPAA Privacy Rule gives individuals a fundamental right to be informed of the privacy practices of health plans and health care providers, as well as to be informed of their privacy rights with respect to their personal health information. Health plans and covered health care providers are required to develop and distribute a notice that provides a clear, user friendly explanation of these rights and practices.

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) recently collaborated with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to develop model notices of privacy practices (NPP) that clearly convey the required information to patients in an accessible format. These model notices can be customized by covered entities (doctors, hospitals and other health care providers covered by HIPAA who maintain patient data, health plans) and then printed for office display and distributed to patients.

This program provies des these new model notices in a digital format for an opportunity to improve what covered entities display online.
